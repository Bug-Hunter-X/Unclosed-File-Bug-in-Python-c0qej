This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in Python: forgetting to close files after opening them.  The `bug.py` file shows the erroneous code that neglects to close a file handle.  The `bugSolution.py` file shows the correct way to handle files, ensuring they're properly closed using a `with` statement or an explicit `close()` call.  This is important for avoiding resource leaks and potential data corruption.
